    <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
    <p>
        Ever since I encountered my first computer, I have been fascinated by the way technology works. My journey towards becoming a software developer began with curiosity and has since evolved into a passion for problem-solving and creating meaningful digital solutions. I want to leverage the power of programming to build tools that can positively impact lives, simplify tasks, and fuel innovation. This field constantly challenges me to learn, grow, and think creatively, which is why I am driven to pursue a career in software development.
